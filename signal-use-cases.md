# Vaadin Signal API Use Cases - Current Implementation

This document describes the 20 use cases currently implemented in this project.

## Introduction

Signals provide a reactive, declarative approach to building UIs where component state automatically synchronizes with application state. The framework manages the dependency graph and lifecycle automatically.

---

## Single-User Use Cases (UC 1-16)

### UC 1: Dynamic Button State

**Description**: Form with validation that reactively enables/disables a submit button based on whether all required fields are filled.

**Key Patterns**:

- `bindEnabled()` for button state
- Signal-based form validation

**Route**: `/use-case-1`

---

### UC 2: Progressive Disclosure with Nested Conditions

**Description**: Multi-level form with nested conditional sections. Selecting options reveals additional fields, which in turn may reveal more fields.

**Key Patterns**:
- Nested conditional rendering
- Signal chains with `map()`
- Multiple levels of `bindVisible()`

**Route**: `/use-case-2`

---

**Description**: Dashboard with components that show/hide based on user roles from Spring Security.

**Key Patterns**:
- Integration with Spring Security
- Role-based UI with signals
- Application-scoped user context signal

**Route**: `/use-case-3`

---

### UC 4: Filtered and Sorted Data Grid

**Description**: Product inventory grid with client-side filtering (search, category, in-stock) and sorting.

**Key Patterns**:

**Route**: `/use-case-12`

---

### UC 13: Current User Signal

**Description**: Application-wide signal holding current user information from Spring Security, used across views and layout.

**Key Patterns**:
- Application-scoped signal (Spring @Component)
- Spring Security integration
- Shared signal across components
- Role-based reactive UI

**Route**: `/use-case-13`

---

### UC 14: Async Data Loading with States

**Description**: User list view with async data loading that properly handles loading/success/error states. Shows loading spinner while fetching, displays data on success, or shows error message with retry button.

**Key Patterns**:
- `Signal<LoadingState<T>>` with Loading/Success/Error states
- Async operations with CompletableFuture
- Loading indicators during async operations
- Error handling with retry mechanism
- Optimistic updates with rollback

**Route**: `/use-case-14`

---

### UC 15: Debounced Search

**Description**: Product search with search-as-you-type functionality. Search input is debounced by 300ms to avoid excessive server calls. Shows searching indicator and cancels in-flight requests when new input arrives.

**Key Patterns**:
- Debouncing signal updates (300ms delay)
- Search only after user stops typing
- Cancel in-flight requests on new input
- Loading state during search
- Highlight matching text in results
- Search count tracking

**Route**: `/use-case-15`

## Signal API Features Used

- `Signal.create()` / `new ValueSignal<>()` - Creating writable signals
- `signal.value()` - Getting/setting signal values
- `signal.map()` - Transforming signal values
- Computed signals combining multiple sources

### Component Bindings
- `bindValue()` - Two-way binding for form fields
- `bindText()` / `bindElementText()` - Dynamic text content
- `bindVisible()` - Conditional visibility
- `bindEnabled()` - Dynamic enabled/disabled state
- `bindStyle()` - CSS style property binding
- `bindBrowserTitle()` - Browser tab title
- `bindChildren()` - Dynamic component children
- `bindItems()` - List binding for Grid/ComboBox
- `bindHelperText()` - Field feedback text

### Advanced Patterns
- Application-scoped signals (Spring @Component)
- Browser event integration (window resize)
- Spring Security integration
- Vaadin Binder integration
- Multi-user shared signals
- Lifecycle management (onAttach/onDetach)

---

## Architecture Patterns

### Application-Scoped Signals

Three Spring components provide application-wide signals:

1. **CurrentUserSignal** - Holds current authenticated user information
2. **CollaborativeSignals** - Shared signals for multi-user use cases
3. **UserSessionRegistry** - Tracks active users with reactive signal

### Multi-User Signal Sharing

Multi-user use cases share signals across sessions:
- Signals stored in application-scoped Spring components
- All users observe the same signal instances
- Updates propagate automatically to all connected clients
- User registration via onAttach/onDetach lifecycle hooks

---

## Implementation Notes

- All use cases compile and run with **Vaadin 25.1-SNAPSHOT**
- Uses **Spring Boot 4.0.1** with Spring Security
- **MissingAPI.java** provides temporary helper methods until official Signal API is available
- Authentication required (except login page) - 4 demo users with different roles

**Total Use Cases**: 20 (16 single-user + 4 multi-user)
