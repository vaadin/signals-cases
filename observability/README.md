# Observability — use cases

A standalone Spring Boot demo module for observability use cases (request
tracing, metrics, structured logging of UI interactions, …). Each concrete use
case is a sibling `ucN` view, mirroring the layout of the other modules in this
repository, and the `HomeView` lists them via the auto-generated menu.

| # | View | What it shows |
| - | ---- | ------------- |
| — | Home | Landing page and auto-generated index of the use cases. |
| 1 | Interaction latency | Per-interaction server vs. client round-trip timings, read from the Micrometer registry. |
| 2 | Application health | A live readout of the app's own signals (sessions, UIs, memory, timings, connection), plus a database-health demo: a button that loads a product catalog and surfaces the classic N+1 join-table fetch — N products cost N+1 single-row fetches — through the Observability Kit's own `vaadin.db.fetch.rows` meter (`vaadin.observability.database=true`). Adding `@BatchSize` to `Product.category` collapses it, exactly as in the bookstore-example. |
